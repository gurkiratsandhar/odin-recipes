    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken marsala is an Italian-American dish of chicken escalopes in a Marsala wine sauce. It is a variation of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes,
    of which there are many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century,when it may have originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala wine is produced. </p>
    <p>
    Slices of chicken breast are coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. 
    The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding garlic. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately. </p>

        <li>If your chicken breasts are large, it’s best to first cut them in half horizontally. </li>
        <li>Once you’ve got four flat filets,  pound them each to an even 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Place the flour, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a ziplock bag.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the bag; seal the bag tightly and shake to coat chicken evenly. Set aside.</li>
